# Programming Challenges

### This is a set of miscellaneous challenges I have participated in while learning programming. To save some space and tidy up my list of git repos, I decided to designate this repo for every programming challenge that requires me to share with others. I will also list the challenges in case anyone is interested in doing them and checking solutions. As there are still many concepts I have yet to learn, any feedback on my code is much appreciated.
